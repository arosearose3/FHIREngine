# Commercial License for FHIREngine

## Dual License Model

FHIREngine is provided under a dual license model designed to meet the development and distribution needs of both commercial distributors (such as OEMs, ISVs and VARs) and open source projects.

### For Commercial Users (OEMs, ISVs, VARs and Other Distributors)
OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers), ISVs (Independent Software Vendors), VARs (Value Added Resellers) and other distributors that combine and distribute commercially licensed software with FHIREngine and do not wish to distribute the source code for the commercially licensed software under version 2 of the GNU General Public License (the "GPL") must enter into a commercial license agreement.

### For Open Source Projects
For developers of Free Open Source Software ("FOSS") applications under the GPL that want to combine and distribute those FOSS applications with FHIREngine, our GPL-licensed version is the best option.

For developers and distributors of open source software under a FOSS license other than the GPL, we make our GPL-licensed components available under a FOSS Exception that enables use of the FHIREngine under certain conditions without causing the entire derivative work to be subject to the GPL.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: When should I purchase a commercial license for FHIREngine?
OEMs, ISVs and VARs that want to embed FHIREngine in their commercial applications but do not want to be subject to the GPL and do not want to release the source code for their proprietary applications should purchase a commercial license. A commercial license means that the GPL does not apply, and includes the assurances that distributors typically find in commercial distribution agreements.
